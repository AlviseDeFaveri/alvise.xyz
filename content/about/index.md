Hi there! My name is **Alvise** and I am a software engineer and security researcher from Italy.

I'm interested in embedded systems, system's security, compilers, weird machines and the interface between hardware and software. I also like a bunch of other stuff, which is not always related to computers.

This blog is an excuse to write about various things that I like, and sometimes about those that I don't like.

## Experience

Some cool things about me:

- 🚀 I **flew a rocket** with the [Skyward Experimental Rocketry](https://skywarder.eu) Team
- 🐉 I'm working on an (LLVM+QEMU)-based **decompiler**, called [rev.ng](https://rev.ng)
- 🏎💨 I ported parts of the **V8 javascript engine**'s backend to RISCV-32
- 🚗 I like **car hacking**, and in particular I wrote my [Master Thesis](https://www.politesi.polimi.it/bitstream/10589/180235/1/2021_10_DeFaveriTron.pdf) on CAN bus attacks
- 🔦 I've been designing and performing **audiovisual shows** with some [good friends](https://beyondcommonideas.org) for almost a decade

## Side Projects

Other stuff that I've been tinkering with:

- 🤖 **Machine learning**, mainly Keras and Tensorflow
- 🕸️ **Web development**, in particular AWS and backend development
- 🦄 **Startups**, either by working in them or contributing in various ways

## Interests

Finally, these are some of the things I like to read about:

- software performance
- hardware and computer architectures
- microarchitectural attacks & defenses
