Hi there! I'm Alvise, a Software Engineer from Italy 🇮🇹.

# About me

I like computers, [program analysis](https://rev.ng), [rockets](https://skywarder.eu), [audiovisual arts](https://beyondcommonideas.org), and I have a passion for understanding how computing machinery works.

I have experience mainly in low-level software topics, such as:
* 🚀 embedded development (space industry)
* 🐉 compilers
* 🔬 binary analysis
* 🚗 automotive security

But I also know something about:
* 🤖 Machine learning
* 🕸️ Web development
* 🦄 Startups

Other things that I have interest in are:
* microarchitectural attacks & defenses
* computer architectures
* in-memory computing
* swarm intelligence
