Hi there! I'm **Alvise**, a (former) software engineer and (now) security researcher with an embedded systems background.

My research interests include embedded & hardware security, program analysis. compilers, weird machines, and the interface between hardware and software. I also like a bunch of other stuff, not necessarily related to computers.

This blog is an excuse to write about various things that I like, and sometimes about things that I don't like too.

## Experience

Some cool things about me:

- 🚀 I **flew a rocket** with the [Skyward Experimental Rocketry](https://skywarder.eu) Team
- 🐉 I worked on an (LLVM+QEMU)-based **decompiler**, called [rev.ng](https://rev.ng)
- 🏎💨 I helped porting **Google's V8 engine** to [RISCV-32](https://chromium-review.googlesource.com/c/v8/v8/+/3807124)
- 🚗 I like **car hacking**, in particular [CAN bus attacks](https://dl.acm.org/doi/abs/10.1145/3548606.3560618)
- 🔦 I've done some cool **audiovisual shows** together with the [BCI collective](https://beyondcommonideas.org)
- 🧑‍🔬 I've recently started a [PhD in System Security](https://www.vusec.net/people/alvise-dft/)

## Side Projects

Other stuff that I've been tinkering with:

- 🤖 **Machine learning**, mainly Keras and Tensorflow
- 🕸️ **Web development**, in particular AWS and backend development
- 🦄 **Startups**, either by working in them or contributing in various ways

## Interests

Finally, these are some of the things I like to read about:

- software performance
- computer architectures
- microarchitectural attacks & defenses
