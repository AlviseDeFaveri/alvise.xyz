Hi there! My name is **Alvise**, and I'm a Software Engineer from Italy 🇮🇹.

This blog is where I document my learning process through the magical world of computers.


# About me

I enjoy exploring how computing machinery works, and
I'm especially fascinated by the interaction between software and hardware.

## Experience

Some cool things I did:

* 🚀 I **flew a rocket**: I was Software Team Lead of the [Skyward](https://skywarder.eu) team and I also worked on the [MWI](https://directory.eoportal.org/web/eoportal/satellite-missions/m/metop-sg) satellite instrument's on-board software
* 🐉 I'm working on an (LLVM+QEMU)-based **decompiler**, called [rev.ng](https://rev.ng)
* 🚗 I like **car hacking**, and in particular I wrote my [Master Thesis](https://www.politesi.polimi.it/bitstream/10589/180235/1/2021_10_DeFaveriTron.pdf) on CAN bus attacks


Other things that I've been tinkering with:
* 🤖 **Machine learning**, mainly Keras and Tensorflow
* 🕸️ **Web development**, in particular AWS and backend development
* 🦄 **Startups**, either by working in them or contributing in various ways

You can check my [Resume](http://cv.alvise.xyz) for more details.
## Interests

Other things that I 'm interested in are:
* audiovisual arts and interactive installations
* hardware
* microarchitectural attacks & defenses
