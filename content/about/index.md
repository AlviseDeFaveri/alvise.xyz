Hi there!

My name is **Alvise**, and I'm a Software Engineer. This blog is where I document my learning process through the magical world of computers.

I enjoy exploring how computing machinery works, and
I'm especially fascinated by the interaction between software and hardware.

## Experiences

Some cool things about me:

- 🚀 I **flew a rocket** with the [Skyward Experimental Rocketry](https://skywarder.eu) Team
- 🐉 I'm working on an (LLVM+QEMU)-based **decompiler**, called [rev.ng](https://rev.ng)
- 🚗 I like **car hacking**, and in particular I wrote my [Master Thesis](https://www.politesi.polimi.it/bitstream/10589/180235/1/2021_10_DeFaveriTron.pdf) on CAN bus attacks
- 🔦 I've been designing and performing **audiovisual shows** with some [good friends](https://beyondcommonideas.org) for almost a decade

## Side Projects

Other stuff that I've been tinkering with:

- 🤖 **Machine learning**, mainly Keras and Tensorflow
- 🕸️ **Web development**, in particular AWS and backend development
- 🦄 **Startups**, either by working in them or contributing in various ways

## Interests

Finally, these are some of the things I like to read about:

- software performance
- hardware and computer architectures
- microarchitectural attacks & defenses
