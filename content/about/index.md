Hi there! I'm **Alvise**, a (former) software engineer with an embedded systems background and (now) PhD student at the Vrije University of Amsterdam in the [VUSec group](https://www.vusec.net/people/alvise-dft/).

I like **microarchitectural attacks**, embedded & **hardware security**, **program analysis**, and anything at interface between hardware and software. I also like music, audiovisual arts, and sometimes humans too.

## Experience

Some cool projects I did before my PhD:

- 🚀 I wrote software for a **sounding rocket** with the [Skyward Experimental Rocketry](https://skywarder.eu) Team
- 🐉 I worked on an (LLVM+QEMU)-based **decompiler**, called [rev.ng](https://rev.ng)
- 🏎 I helped porting **Google's V8 engine** to [RISCV-32](https://chromium-review.googlesource.com/c/v8/v8/+/3807124)
- 🔦 I realized some **audiovisual installations** together with the [BCI collective](https://beyondcommonideas.org) back in my hometown

## Research

- I'm working on finding microarchitectural bugs in CPU designs
- 👻 I built a (software) scanner for [Spectre Gadgets]() (under embargo)
- 🚗 I worked on **car hacking**, in particular [CAN bus attacks](https://dl.acm.org/doi/abs/10.1145/3548606.3560618)
