Hi there! My name is Alvise, and I'm a Software Engineer from Italy 🇮🇹.

# About me

I'm an enthusiastic and curious person, and I have a passion for the nitty gritty details of how computing machinery works.

I started coding in high school, while I was enrolled in a humanistic course of study (philosophy, latin, ancient greek and that kind of stuff), and since then I've explored different areas of computer science.

<!-- I started with web development during high school, then I chose Electronics for
my Bachelor's, switched to Computer Engineering for my Master's and joined
the [Skyward](https://skywarder.eu) student team, that was building a sounding rocket. I later
became Software Team Lead of the group and participated to 2 launch campaigns.
After that, I got into computer security, in particular I completed my Master's
degree with a thesis on novel attack techniques in the field automotive security
and I started working in the field of binary analysis. -->

You can check my [Resume](http://cv.alvise.xyz) if you'd like more details.

## Experiences

My main fields of expertise are:
* 🚀 *embedded development*, especially in the aerospace field: I wrote a big portion
of [Skyward](https://skywarder.eu) rockets' [on-board software](https://github.com/skyward-er/skyward-boardcore) and worked on the
[MWI](https://directory.eoportal.org/web/eoportal/satellite-missions/m/metop-sg) satellite instrument's on-board software
* 🐉 *compilers*, in particular compiler theory and the LLVM framework
* 🔬 *binary analysis*, symbolic execution and [decompilation](https://github.com/revng)
* 🚗 *automotive security*, in particular CAN bus security, on which I wrote
my [Master Thesis](https://www.politesi.polimi.it/bitstream/10589/180235/1/2021_10_DeFaveriTron.pdf)

I also have a good knowledge of:
* 🤖 *Machine learning*, mainly Keras and Tensorflow
* 🕸️ *Web development*, in particular the Django framework and vanilla JS
* 🦄 *Startups*, since I [work in one](https://rev.ng), I've [contributed to one](https://blinklastmile.com) before, and
I was also co-founder of [one] in my last year of high school (**spoiler:** it doesn't exist anymore)

## Interests

There are many fascinating topics in Computer Science that I like to read
about, even if I don't have any hands-on experience about them (*yet?*):
* microarchitectural attacks & defenses
* computer architectures
* in-memory computing
* swarm intelligence
