Hi there! My name is **Alvise**, and I'm a Software Engineer from Italy 🇮🇹.

This blog is where I document my learning process through the magical world of computers.


# About me

I enjoy exploring how computing machinery works, and
I'm especially fascinated by the interaction between software and hardware.

## Experience


My main fields of expertise are:
* 🚀 **embedded development**, especially in the aerospace field: I wrote a big portion
of [Skyward](https://skywarder.eu) rockets' [on-board software](https://github.com/skyward-er/skyward-boardcore) and worked on the
[MWI](https://directory.eoportal.org/web/eoportal/satellite-missions/m/metop-sg) satellite instrument's on-board software
* 🐉 **compilers**, in particular compiler theory and the LLVM framework
* 🔬 **binary analysis**, symbolic execution and [decompilation](https://rev.ng)
* 🚗 **embedded security**, and in particular CAN bus security, on which I wrote
my [Master Thesis](https://www.politesi.polimi.it/bitstream/10589/180235/1/2021_10_DeFaveriTron.pdf)


I also have a good knowledge of:
* 🤖 **Machine learning**, mainly Keras and Tensorflow
* 🕸️ **Web development**, in particular AWS and backend development
* 🦄 **Startups**, since I [work in one](https://rev.ng) and I'm closely connected to [another one](https://blinklastmile.com), to which I contributed during the
early stages

You can check my [Resume](http://cv.alvise.xyz) for more details.
## Interests

Other things that I 'm interested in are:
* audiovisual arts and interactive installations
* emerging computer architectures
* microarchitectural attacks & defenses
* explainability in the field of AI
