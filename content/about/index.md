Hi there! My name is Alvise, and I'm a Software Engineer from Italy 🇮🇹.

This blog is where I document my learning process through the magical world of computers. If you like software, hardware, or anything that stands in the middle, you're in the right place.


# About me

I enjoy exploring how computing machinery works, and
I'm especially fascinated by the interaction between software and hardware in its
different aspects (architectures, compilers, security).

<!-- My background in Computer Science is quite varied: I obtained my high school
diploma in classical studies, during which also learned how to write web
applications, and then started my Bachelor's in Electronics Engineering. I later
switched to Computer Engineering, where I focused on Embedded Development.
During my Master's, I did an exchange program focused on Artificial Intelligence
and Data Science, briefly worked in an early-stage startup as a backend
developer with sysadmin tasks, and became passionate about Computer Security,
which is now my day job. -->

<!-- ## Experience -->

My main fields of expertise are:
* 🚀 *embedded development*, especially in the aerospace field: I wrote a big portion
of [Skyward](https://skywarder.eu) rockets' [on-board software](https://github.com/skyward-er/skyward-boardcore) and worked on the
[MWI](https://directory.eoportal.org/web/eoportal/satellite-missions/m/metop-sg) satellite instrument's on-board software
* 🐉 *compilers*, in particular compiler theory and the LLVM framework
* 🔬 *binary analysis*, symbolic execution and [decompilation](https://github.com/revng)
* 🚗 *automotive security*, in particular CAN bus security, on which I wrote
my [Master Thesis](https://www.politesi.polimi.it/bitstream/10589/180235/1/2021_10_DeFaveriTron.pdf)

I also have a good knowledge of:
* 🤖 *Machine learning*, mainly Keras and Tensorflow
* 🕸️ *Web development*, in particular AWS and backend development
* 🦄 *Startups*, since I [work in one](https://rev.ng) and I'm closely connected to [another one](https://blinklastmile.com), to which I contributed during the
early stages

<!-- ## Interests -->

Among many exciting research that is being done right now in the field
of computer science, some of the things that I like to read about are:
* microarchitectural attacks & defenses
* in-memory computing
* swarm robotics
* explainability in the field of AI
