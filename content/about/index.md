Hi there! My name is **Alvise**, and I'm a Software Engineer from Italy 🇮🇹.

This blog is where I document my learning process through the magical world of computers.


# About me

I enjoy exploring how computing machinery works, and
I'm especially fascinated by the interaction between software and hardware.

## Experiences

Some cool things about me:

* 🚀 I **flew a rocket** as [Skyward](https://skywarder.eu)'s Software Team Lead and I worked on the [MWI](https://directory.eoportal.org/web/eoportal/satellite-missions/m/metop-sg) satellite instrument's on-board software
* 🐉 I'm working on an (LLVM+QEMU)-based **decompiler**, called [rev.ng](https://rev.ng)
* 🚗 I like **car hacking**, and in particular I wrote my [Master Thesis](https://www.politesi.polimi.it/bitstream/10589/180235/1/2021_10_DeFaveriTron.pdf) on CAN bus attacks
* 🔦 I've designed various **audiovisual shows** and **interactive installations** together with some [good friends](https://beyondcommonideas.org)
## Side Projects

Other stuff that I've been tinkering with:
* 🤖 **Machine learning**, mainly Keras and Tensorflow
* 🕸️ **Web development**, in particular AWS and backend development
* 🦄 **Startups**, either by working in them or contributing in various ways

## Interests

Finally, these are some of the things I like to read about:
* software performance
* hardware and computer architectures
* microarchitectural attacks & defenses
