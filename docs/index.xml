And what&amp;rsquo;s up with all that.got.plt nonsense you see when decompiling a binary? Here are some sketches to visualize it.

Intro: Static vs Dynamic Linking First of all, we need to understand the difference between a statically linked binary and a dynamically linked one:</description></item><item><title>Software Security 101</title><link>https://www.alvise.xyz/sketches/software-security-101/</link><pubDate>Sat, 14 Jan 2023 00:00:00 +0000</pubDate><guid>https://www.alvise.xyz/sketches/software-security-101/</guid><description>These are a few sketches covering very basic topics of Computer Security.

My research interests include microarchitectural attacks, embedded &amp;amp; hardware security, program analysis, and anything at interface between hardware and software. I also like a bunch of other stuff, not necessarily related to computers.</description></item><item><title/><link>https://www.alvise.xyz/projects/</link><pubDate>Mon, 01 Jan 0001 00:00:00 +0000</pubDate><guid>https://www.alvise.xyz/projects/</guid><description>// TODO</description></item></channel></rss>
